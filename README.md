# TODO:
## Continue Testing Card Class (DUE: 1/24/16 00:00:00)
* Make the test cases more extensible by combining them into a list
* The list element should have:
    * a card configuration 
    * an expected output
## Think about the Player Class (DUE: 1/30/16 00:00:00)
* It will have a list of cards 
* Think about how the player want to know about his hand as a collective
